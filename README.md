### Step 1: Access Microsoft Entra ID and Locate Custom Domain Names

Sign in to the Azure portal and search for Microsoft Entra ID. Once inside, locate and select the Custom Domain Names tab. From here, you will add your purchased custom domain from GoDaddy as the primary DNS. This process mirrors real-world domain integration steps for enterprise environments.<br>
<br>
- Ensures your Azure tenant is associated with a professional, branded domain.
- Provides an email identity aligned with your company name instead of onmicrosoft.com.
- Prepares the environment for branding, email, and authentication customization.<br>

### Step 2: Navigate to Custom Domain Names

From the left-hand menu in Microsoft Entra ID, select Custom Domain Names. By default, you will see only your tenant's .onmicrosoft.com domain. Companies and clients typically prefer their own branded domain for professional communication.<br>
<br>
- Improves brand identity by replacing the default Microsoft domain.
- Enables professional email addresses (e.g., user@company.com).
- Meets client and organizational requirements for domain branding.<br>

<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 3: Add the Custom Domain
Click Add Custom Domain. A panel will appear on the right side of the screen. Enter your purchased domain name (from GoDaddy) and select Add Domain.<br>
<br>
- Registers your owned domain with Azure.
- Creates a verification process for domain ownership.
- Prepares for DNS record configuration.<br>

<br>

<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 4: Retrieve TXT Record Information
Azure will prompt you to create a TXT record in your DNS provider’s settings. Copy the following details:

- Alias or Host Name
- Destination / Points To Address
- TTL (Time to Live)
<br>
- TXT records verify ownership of the domain.<br>
- Ensures secure integration between Azure and the DNS provider.<br>
- Prevents domain spoofing by confirming legitimate control.<br>

<br>
<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 5: Access GoDaddy DNS Management
Sign in to your GoDaddy account. Navigate to your domain, select the DNS tab, and open DNS Records. Choose Add New Record.<br>
<br>
- Accessing DNS records is necessary to insert Azure’s TXT verification record.
- Ensures updates are made at the authoritative DNS provider.
- Initiates the verification process for Azure.<br>

<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 6: Add TXT Record in GoDaddy
In the Add New Record pop-up:

- Type: TXT Record
- Name: @
- Value: MS=ms35983121
- TTL: Custom, set to 3600<br>
Click Save.<br>
<br>
- @ points to the root domain.
- MS=... value is generated by Azure for verification.
- TTL sets how quickly the change propagates.<br>
<br>

### Step 7: Verify the Domain in Azure

Return to Azure Custom Domain Names and click Verify for the domain. On the right-hand verification panel, you should see Domain Name is Verified.<br>
<br>
- Confirms DNS changes have propagated successfully.
- Officially links the domain to your Azure tenant.
- Allows the domain to be used for sign-ins and email.<br>

<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 8: Set as Primary Domain

From Azure Custom Domain Names, confirm the status shows Verified for your domain (farmhouzdesign.com). Click the domain link and set it as Primary.<br>
<br>
- Ensures all new users default to the branded domain.
- Creates a consistent user identity across Microsoft 365 services.
- Improves professional appearance for all communications.<br>

### Step 9: Verify Domain Assignment on Users

Go to Users in Microsoft Entra ID, select a newly created user, and confirm their sign-in address uses the custom domain.<br>
<br>
- Verifies that the domain change has been applied to user accounts.
- Confirms readiness for production email and login use.
- Demonstrates successful domain branding in a live environment.<br>
